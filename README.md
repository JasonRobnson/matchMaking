# MatchMaker

This project allows a user to take a survey, and based on that survey. They will be matched with a
potential friend that shares some of the same interest. 

My purpose for coding this was to get practice at my first Fullstack app. I hoped to combine all the
 small pieces of technology that I've learned so far, and merge them into a full functioning app.
